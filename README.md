Tasks I performed during my WEB studies

1. Points game
   The goal of the game: to clear the game board of circles.
   Each click on a circle removes it from the board and puts you on the path to victory!
2. keyboard
   This is a fun keyboard.
   You have the ability to change colors, font size, and type however you want.
